            <p class="para">Detective Sarah Williams received a call from the police station early in the morning. A
                murder had been committed at the city's luxurious hotel, and she was needed to investigate the crime
                scene. Sarah quickly gathered her equipment and headed to the hotel.
                Upon arriving at the hotel, Sarah discovered that the victim was a wealthy businessman named John Smith.
                He had been found dead in his hotel room, and the police suspected foul play.
                Sarah began her investigation by searching the hotel room for clues. She found a few pieces of evidence,
                but nothing that could lead to a clear suspect.
                As the day went on, Sarah interviewed witnesses and examined more evidence. Finally, she was able to
                piece together the events that led to John Smith's murder.
                Sarah questioned a hotel employee named Tom, who had been working the night shift when the murder
                occurred. He seemed nervous and had scratches on his arms, which made Sarah suspicious. However, upon
                further investigation, she discovered that Tom had been in the hotel's basement during the time of the
                murder, and had no involvement in the crime.
                Sarah interviewed a hotel guest named Lisa, who had been staying in the room next to John Smith's. Lisa
                claimed that she didn't hear anything unusual during the night of the murder. However, when Sarah asked
                her about the distinctive perfume scent found in the victim's room, Lisa became nervous and gave vague
                answers. Was Lisa involved in the murder?</p>
